<h4>Multiple Inheritance : </h4>
<p>Multiple inheritance means that a subclass can inherit from two or more superclasses.</p>
<h4>MultiLevel Inheritance : </h4>
<p>In multi-level inheritance, you have a base (or parent) class at the top of the hierarchy. 
    Below it, there's a derived (or child) class that inherits from the base class.</p>
<h4>Hierarchical Inheritance : </h4>
<p>When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance.</p>
